I'm in the process of porting all of my work into github pages and jekyll.  Knowing very little about web <i>design</i>, I've decided to fork an [existing template](https://github.com/st4ple/solid-jekyll) that I really liked and go from there.  All I had to strip out most of the "business" content like clients and testimonials, and update the config files with my own information.

Now all that left is to flesh out the site with more content like projects and blog posts.
