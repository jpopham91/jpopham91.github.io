The recent release of AshleyMadison.com user's data has taken the internet by storm.  While many are interested in digging up the dirty secrets of friends, neighbors, and significant others, some of us are just interested in what we can learn from the data.

Using the list of transactions, I made a plot attempting to shed some light on the demographics of cheating.  Totaling the transaction amounts by state, and dividing by each state's population, we can see which states' citizens spent the most on average.

Note that Alabama is at the top.  This is could potentially be due to users are making fake accounts and not changing the state from the default setting.
