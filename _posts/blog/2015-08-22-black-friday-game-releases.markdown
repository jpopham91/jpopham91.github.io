It shouldn't really come as a surprise, but apparently companies like having on shelves for the the biggest shopping day of the year.  More than $50 billion was spend during Black Friday weekend in 2014, which is generally considered to be the start of the Christmas shopping season.

We see an interesting pattern in the release dates of video games in relation to the unofficial holiday.  Histograms of video game release dates show that most games are released in the weeks leading up to Black Friday, with a plurality of releases immediately before it.

It's pretty apparent that Black Friday is a deadline of sorts for video game publishers.
