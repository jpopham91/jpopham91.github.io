####Clustering NHL Players

[**You can access the interactive similarity map here**](http://jpopham91.github.io/assets/forwards.html)

The goal of this project was to determine the similarities between different NHL forwards, and to label groups of similar players by role.

The players were clustered relative to the rates of nine different stats, like goals per 60 minutes of ice time.  The clusters were labeled and the data was projected into two dimensions and plotted.  The distance between players corresponds to the similarity in playstyles, so exceptional and unique players like Crosby and Datsyuk are isolated in the fringes of the map.
