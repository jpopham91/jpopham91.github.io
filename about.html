            <h4>More About Me.</h4>
            <p>
                After completing a B.S. and M.S. in physics at the Rochester Institute of Technology, Jake Popham found his way into the field of data science specializing in machine learning and predictive modeling.
                His graduate research involved modeling the quantum effects on electrons in nano-scale semiconductor devices, where he honed an analytic skillset which has proven to be an invaluable foundation in his development as a data scientist.

                Jake took a data science position with CCRi in the fall of 2015, when he joined an R&D team tasked with building spatio-temporal models which fuse disparate, unstructured data to predict a wide range of events.
                During his brief tensure, Jake has made contributes throughout the entire software stack, from network and database administration, to server-side modeling and algorithms in python and scala, and front end UI/UX design in HTML/CSS/JS.
                His work at CCRi has also given him the opportunity to learn a variety of "big data" technologies, like Hadoop, MapReduce, Spark, and NoSQL.

                Outside of work, Jake is always keeping himself busy with personal projects. He loves a challenge, and routinely puts his models to the test in competitions like those on <a href="http://kaggle.com">kaggle</a> and <a href="http://codeacademy.com">codeacademy</a>.
                He's the author of <a href="https://github.com/jpopham91/berserker">berserker</a>, the open source framework build on top of scikit-learn for building ensembles of machine learning models.
                Jake also analyzes open data sets and reports his findings in <a href="/blog/">his blog.</a>
